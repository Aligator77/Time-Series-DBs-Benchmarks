# Time Series DBs Stress Test

## Targets

1. ElasticSearch
2. InfluxDB
3. Kairosdb

## Benchmark ElasticSearch

Example:

`./es_metrics_benchmark.py 1 2 60 --number-of-metrics-per-bulk 60000`

```
In this case, we do es_metrics_benchmark with the following parameters:
min_num_of_clients = 1,
max_num_of_clients = 2,
running_seconds = 60,
number-of-metrics-per-bulk = 60000,

which means,
Range the number of clients from 1(min_num_of_clients) to 2(max_num_of_clients);
Use number-of-metrics-per-bulk = 60000, which can ensure the physical size of the bulk is about 6-8 MB;
Set the running_seconds for each benchmark case with a certain thread number(num_of_clients).
```

To see all `Mandatory Parameters` and `Optional Parameters`:

Run `./es_metrics_benchmark.py -h`


#### Mandatory Parameters (ElasticSearch)
| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `min_num_of_clients` | The minimum number of threads that send bulks to ES(threads num will range from min_client_num to max_client_num) |
| `max_num_of_clients` | The maximum number of threads that send bulks to ES(threads num will range from min_client_num to max_client_num) |
| `running_seconds` | How long should the test run. Note: it might take a bit longer, as sending of all bulks who's creation has been initiated is allowed |

#### Optional Parameters (ElasticSearch)
| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--es-hosts`       | A list of IPs in the Elasticsearch cluster (no protocol and port, use default) |
| `--indices`       | Number of indices to write to (default 8) |
| `--number-of-shards`       | How many shards per index (default 3) |
| `--number-of-replicas`       | How many replicas per index (default 1) |
| `--number-of-metrics-per-bulk` | How many metric docs each bulk request should contain (default 1000)|
| `--cleanup`       | Boolean field. If Delete the indices after completion(default False) |
| `--stats-interval`       | Number of seconds to wait between stats prints (default 30), How frequent to show the statistics |


#### Idea (ElasticSearch Benchmark)

We use bulk indexing requests for optimal performance.
Obiviously, itâ€™s the physical size of the bulk that is more important than the document count.

1. Size Per Bulk

```
   The physical size of the bulk that is more important than the document count.
   So start with a bulk size around 5-15 MB and slowly increase it until you do not see performance gains any more.
   By default, `--number-of-metrics-per-bulk = 60000, at which the physical size per Bulk is 6-8 MB`
```

2. Concurrency
```
   Then start increasing the concurrency of your bulk ingestion (multiple threads, etc)
   Use `min_num_of_clients` and `max_num_of_clients` parameters to define the range of thread number.
```

3. Round-Robin
```
   By default round-robin strategy is used by the ES-PY Api for load balancing.
```

4. Marvel Plugin & EsRejectedExecutionException
```
   Monitor your nodes with Marvel and/or tools like isolate, top, and ps to see when resources start to bottleneck.
   If you start to receive EsRejectedExecutionException,
   Then your cluster is at-capacity with some resource and you need to reduce concurrency
```
